# LeetCode Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, implemented in Rust. It uses the [LeetSync](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetsync-leetcode-to-gith/ppkbejeolfcbaomanmbpjdbkfcjfhjnd?hl=en&pli=1) extension to automatically sync and push submissions from LeetCode to this repository.
